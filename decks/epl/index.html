          <h3>Problem: Dichotomy of AI Adoption</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>AI speeds up delivery but requires deep technical skills to catch subtle errors—skills we risk losing.
            </li>
            <li>Generally we bill time not outcomes</li>
            <li>How do we get our people using AI on client projects?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Solutions: Dichotomy of AI Adoption</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Reframe the narrative: we're not choosing between AI and traditional engineering.</li>
            <li>Protect and develop the senior engineers who provide that quality backstop.</li>
            <li>Build this into how we assess and develop talent: not "can you use AI tooling" but "can you catch when
              it's wrong and fix it."</li>
            <li>Encourage AI clauses on fall forward work</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Problem: Account Pipeline and Lifecycle</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>We lack a technical lens into account performance</li>
            <li>Are accounts being appropriately supported with growth in mind?</li>
            <li>Talent is fragmented across accounts; we rely on who's visible, not who's best.</li>
            <li>How do access new and interesting work?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Solutions: Account Pipeline and Lifecycle</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Informal EPL <-> account catchups</li>
            <li>Alternate routes for recognition via people leads</li>
            <li>Better understanding of the sales pipeline from an engineering lens</li>
            <li>Build and nurture bid skills in the region</li>
          </ul>
